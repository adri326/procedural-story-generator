# procedural-story-generator

Generates stories which often makes little or no sense. **WIP**

## Installation and running the thing

Clone this repository and run the project using `node`. As the project is in development, there is no real stuff behind it, running it will only display you a test story, with `A` giving their watch or pen to `B` and `B` gifting them with their watch or pen.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adri326/procedural-story-generator.git
cd procedural-story-generator
node ./
```
